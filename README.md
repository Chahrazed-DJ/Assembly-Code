# Assembly-Code
This is the English version of the README. For French, please see the two statements in the folder [énoncé](./énoncé).

## Description 

>  Two assembly codes for two statements were assigned using the standard intel syntax for writing x86 assembly code,
- The first statement asks to :
  - create a code that reads a string of up to 20 characters
  - write a function to test if a byte in this string is a lowercase letter or not. It is assumed that the function takes as input the index of the byte to check in SI and returns the result in AL
  - Convert all lowercase letters to uppercase in the read string
  - Leave all special characters and numbers unchanged
  -  Display the obtained string again
 
- The second statement contains two programs written in the C language. It is requested to :
  - write them in assembly language, passing through the stack, with a display of the result of a variable 'c,' assuming that it is a two-digit number
